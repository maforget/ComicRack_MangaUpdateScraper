#### Check my plugins for ComicRack Community Edition:

- **[Android Client](https://github.com/maforget/ComicRackKeygen/releases/tag/1.0). Includes the link to the Android Client. It still work correctly with the Community Edition & still works with the Latest Android 14 (although for 14+ you will need to install via ADB). Also includes stuff like a Keygen & a Support Pack for the Original ComicRack, but those aren't required anymore with the Community Edition anymore.**
